# Forest Cover Type Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains code for predicting forest cover type using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about various geographical and environmental factors that can affect the type of forest cover in a given area. 

## Algorithms

Various machine learning algorithms were used in this project, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Extra Trees
- Grdient Boosting 
- Stacking Classifier
- Voting Classifier

## Usage

To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file `Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction.ipynb`. The notebook contains all the code required to load and preprocess the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance. 

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting forest cover type based on environmental factors. The results suggest that Extra Trees is a particularly effective algorithm for this task.
