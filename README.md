# Forest Cover Type Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains code for predicting forest cover type using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about various geographical and environmental factors that can affect the type of forest cover in a given area. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype. It contains information about 581,012 geographical points, each with 54 features.

## Algorithms

Various machine learning algorithms were used in this project, including:

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting

## Usage

To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file `Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction.ipynb`. The notebook contains all the code required to load and preprocess the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance. 

## Results

The best performing model was a Random Forest classifier with an accuracy of 94.4%. More details about the performance of each algorithm can be found in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting forest cover type based on environmental factors. The results suggest that Random Forest is a particularly effective algorithm for this task.
